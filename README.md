# Polynomial Equation Using The Least Squares Method
Approximate a dataset to a polynomial equation using the least squares method using Python. 
This code has been written with [Neutrium](https://neutrium.net/mathematics/least-squares-fitting-of-a-polynomial/) webpage wide.

## What is needed to run this code
In order to run this code you will need:
- Python 3.7
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Files
I've used two files to keep everyting organized:
- **Main:** Here I define the datasets and the polynomial order of the outout equation. Also in this file I create the matrices, fill them and solve the **A** matrix which is the matrix of the coefficients. And finally I show in console the output equation as well as plotting the graph showing the dataset and the equation.
- **Defs:** In this file I define all the operations that are needed in order to fill the matrices.
